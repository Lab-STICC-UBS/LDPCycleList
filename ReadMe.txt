Note : Version 1.1
- now can be used with non regular matrices


How to use : 

- Compile with the command make (uses gcc), or compile the LDPCycleList.c file (it is alone)
- Run with the command ./LDPCycleList [Path of the matrix file] [Maximum lengh of cycle to search]

ex: ./LDPCycleList ./Dc3_N6.txt 14

Alist format : http://perso-etis.ensea.fr/~declercq/graphs.php

6 4 			//N M
2 3 			//dv dc
2 2 2 2 2 2 	//dv of each column
3 3 3 3 		//dc of each line

1 3 			//position of non zero elements in each column (position of first element noted '1', not like in C++)
2 4 
1 4 
3 4 
1 2 
2 3 

1 3 5 			//position of non zero elements in each line
2 5 6 
1 4 6 
2 3 4

Associated matrix :
1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 0 0


You can use the matlab scipt 'matrix2alist.m' by CÃ©dric Marchand to convert a matrix to the right format.


The list of cycles are given in the 'cycles' folders : this is an example of a cycles of lenght 6 in the matrix below :
1 1 3 4 4 3 1 		// mean Check Node 1, Variable node 1, Check 3, V4, C4, V3, C1 -> the check node we began with. 

1 * 6 * X *			//the cycle in the matrix (play the game where you draw something linking the points in the right order)
* X * * X X
2 * * 3 * X
* X 5 4 * *
